name: "[Tool] Make AutoML Predictions"
description: |
  Takes in either a Pandas Dataframe and uses that to request a prediction from the specified DataRobot model.

  Note the argument `columns_to_return_with_predictions`: this will tell the tool to return columns 
  from the input dataset if you want. Use this to make sure you can interpret the predictions. 
  For example, you may want to return ID or other identifying columns so you can see which prediction is which. 
  You can't rely on the index or order of the predictions.
